# Memory Allocation Visualizer

A comprehensive web-based visualization tool for memory allocation algorithms with three different modes: Single Algorithm, Comparison Mode, and Partition Mode.

## Features

### 🎯 Three Visualization Modes

1. **Single Mode**: Visualize one algorithm at a time
2. **Comparison Mode**: Compare First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit algorithms side-by-side
3. **Partition Mode**: Fixed partitions with process allocation

### 🔧 Supported Algorithms

- **First Fit**: Allocates the first available block that fits
- **Best Fit**: Allocates the smallest available block that fits
- **Worst Fit**: Allocates the largest available block that fits

### 📊 Key Features

- Real-time memory visualization with color-coded segments
- Process management with arrival times
- Interactive timeline with playback controls
- Detailed execution logs and statistics
- Export functionality for PNG screenshots and trace data
- Responsive design with dark theme
